# Day 15: Same in Reverse

---

## ✅ Challenge

### 🔹 Problem Statement  
Write a function called `same_in_reverse` that takes a **string** and checks whether it reads the **same backwards** as forwards.

If it is the same, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

This is essentially a **palindrome check**.

### ✏️ Example

```python
same_in_reverse("dad")       # Output: True
same_in_reverse("python")    # Output: False
same_in_reverse("level")     # Output: True
