# Day 1: Division and Square-root

## Challenge
Write a function called `divide_or_square` that takes one argument (a number) and returns:

- the **square root** of the number if it is divisible by 5
- the **remainder** of the number when divided by 5 if it is **not** divisible by 5

### Example
```python
divide_or_square(10)  # returns 3.16 (square root of 10)
divide_or_square(7)   # returns 2 (7 % 5)
