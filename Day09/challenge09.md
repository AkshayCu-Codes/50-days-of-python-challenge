# Day 9: Biggest Odd Number

## ✅ Challenge  
Create a function called `biggest_odd` that takes a **string of digits** as input and returns the **biggest odd number** found in that string.

- You must use **list comprehension** in your solution.
- Assume the input string contains only numeric characters (`0-9`).

---

## ✏️ Example

```python
biggest_odd('23569')   # returns 9
biggest_odd('42068')   # returns 1 (no odd, return appropriate fallback)
