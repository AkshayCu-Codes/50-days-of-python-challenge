# Day 24: Average Calories


### üîπ Problem Statement  
Create a function called `average_calories` that calculates the **average calorie intake** of a user over multiple days.

- The function should **ask the user to input calories** for each day.
- When the user types `'done'`, the input should stop.
- The function should then **calculate and return the average** of the entered calorie values.

Make sure to handle invalid inputs using `try`/`except`.
