# Day 7: A String Range

## ✅ Challenge  
Write a function called `string_range` that takes a **single number** as input and returns a **string of its range** separated by dots (`.`).

- The string should include numbers starting from `0` up to (but not including) the given number.
- Each number should be separated by a dot.

---

## ✏️ Example

```python
string_range(6)  # returns '0.1.2.3.4.5'
